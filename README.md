## Introduction

I used Gatsby to build the website.
To execute this repository: 
1. follow the below first step (install Gatsby via npm)
2. instead of creating new, boilerplate gatsby, run this:
```gatsby new <your project name> <this repository link>```

New Gatsby project will be added, with this repo as starter.




### Starting Gatsby

The default Gatsby starter.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

### Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:
```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd gatsby-example-site
npm run develop
```
